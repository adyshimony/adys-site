### Miniscript

Bitcoin Script is powerful, enabling multisig, timelocks, vaults, hashlocks, and more. Yet writing raw Script is notoriously complex: it's stack-based, easy to get wrong, hard to compose and full of quirky rules.

Miniscript to the rescue!
It's a structured language that makes Bitcoin scripts safer, analyzable, and composable.

Developed by Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra, and Sanket Kanjalkar, Miniscript bridges the gap between high level spending policies and low level Bitcoin Script.

With Miniscript, Bitcoin spending conditions are built in three layers:

* Policy Language: Designed for humans. Simple, declarative conditions.
* Miniscript: A structured and analyzable representation that ensures correctness and supports composition
* Bitcoin Script: The actual execution layer interpreted by Bitcoin nodes

### Miniscript Studio

Experimenting with Miniscript can still be challenging, which is why I built Miniscript Studio: a complete online IDE for exploring policies, compiling them into scripts, and analyzing every detail. Miniscript Studio comes with detailed examples, range descriptors and Taproot support, key variables, better error messages and more.

Studio uses [Rust Miniscript](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) crate to compile expressions, and https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/ as source of truth reference. While these tools exist and are production-proven, Studio tries to make Miniscript more accessible and easy to learn, by providing full IDE features around the compiler.

### Policy Editor

The Policy Editor is the starting point for writing spending conditions in a high level, human readable format. You can load predefined examples, study their descriptions, and compile them into Miniscript and Bitcoin Script. Just choose an example, press compile, and scroll down for Miniscript details. Compile policy will always trigger Miniscript compile, unless it's a Taproot with more than one branch to select.
Read the example descriptions as they cover all technical aspects of the example. You can collapse descriptions to save space.

To make policies easier to read and work with, the editor provides formatting options. You can hide key names to display raw values, indent expressions for readability, clean extra characters before compilation, copy, share and more.

### Miniscript Editor

The Miniscript Editor is for working directly with Miniscript expressions. It accepts pasted expressions or loads examples, and shows detailed compile results with spending analysis. When you compile a policy, it will auto load its result into the Miniscript editor and compile it, but you can work with the Miniscript editor independently, without Policy.

### Script Area

The Script Area displays the compiled result in multiple formats: hex, ASM, and as an address. You can toggle between mainnet and testnet, or switch between Legacy, SegWit, and Taproot contexts and compile again. Note that Taproot uses x-only keys, make sure to choose the right context to your keys.

### Extract Keys

Miniscript requires real public keys, but users may not have them handy. The Extract Keys function automatically generates the missing keys.

For example, writing "or(pk(Nadav),pk(Aviv))" without defining Nadav and Aviv may raise a compilation error, as the compiler doesn't recognize Nadav or Aviv variables.

By clicking Extract Keys button, usable public keys are generated automatically so the expression compiles without errors. Same goes when using hex values in expressions - extract keys will create new keys var for the missing keys (only).

You can also just choose "Extract keys" from the error message itself.

### Key Variables Management

For more control, the Key Variables section allows you to manage key values manually. You can add, edit, or delete variables, and generate them from predefined pools. Keys are always stored locally.

### Default Variables

Miniscript Studio comes with predefined example keys to help you get started immediately: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Eva etc. You can see the full list under the key variable section.

These default variables let you experiment instantly. For example, you can immediately write and compile policies like:

- or(pk(Alice),pk(Bob)) - Simple 1-of-2
- thresh(2,pk(Alice),pk(Bob),pk(Charlie)) - 2-of-3 multisig

You can also override any default by defining your value to any key. You made a mess? No problem. Just hit "restore defaults" to regenerate all default keys.

### HD Wallet Descriptors

Miniscript Studio supports hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet descriptors, including xpubs and tpubs. When range descriptors are used, the editor provides an index field for address derivation and supports multipath syntax for external/change branches. This way you can work with complex expressions with multiple descriptors without the hassle to edit the expression.

üëâ [Try Range descriptor in Studio](https://adys.dev/miniscript#example=miniscript-range_descriptor)

### Lift Functionality

The lift feature allows raw Bitcoin Script to be reversed into Miniscript and Policy form.

For example, pasting the ASM ‚ÄúAlice OP_CHECKSIG OP_IFDUP OP_NOTIF Bob OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 144 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_ENDIF‚Äù produces the Miniscript ‚Äúor_d(pk(Alice),and_v(v:pk(Bob),older(144)))‚Äù and the higher-level policy ‚Äúor(pk(Alice),and(pk(Bob),older(144)))‚Äù. This makes complex raw scripts far easier to understand.

Keep in mind that not all scripts can be lifted.
For example, scripts with public key hashes can't be lifted.

### Taproot Support

Taproot introduced new ways of structuring Bitcoin outputs, and Miniscript Studio provides full support for exploring them. You can load Taproot policy examples and compile them in single-leaf/key, script-path, or key+script path contexts.

Compiling the policy "or(pk(David),or(pk(Helen),pk(Uma)))" shows how the same logic can be represented in different Taproot contexts, with branch expressions automatically loaded into the Miniscript editor for inspection. When there are more than one branch, Studio provides a UI to choose what Miniscript expression to load into the editor.

üëâ [Try Multi branch policy in Studio](https://adys.dev/miniscript#example=policy-multi_branch)

### Taproot Script Paths

When working with Taproot Miniscript expressions, the tool shows each available script path, the full descriptor, and a spending cost analysis.

The miniscript expression ‚Äúor_d(multi_a(5,Fed1,Fed2,Fed3,Fed4,Fed5,Fed6,Fed7),and_v(v:multi_a(2,Emergency1,Emergency2,Emergency3),older(4032)))‚Äù is displayed as two paths: multi_a(5,Fed1,Fed2,Fed3,Fed4,Fed5,Fed6,Fed7) and and_v(v:multi_a(2,Emergency1,Emergency2,Emergency3),older(4032)), with their descriptors and weight analysis provided side by side for comparison.
Script path will use NUMS to generate script only paths; Script + key path will generate script paths and key paths spending; and Single leaf will create a Taproot leaf with the full script for complex scripts. For key only scripts, it will create a key-only spending path as it's the most efficient.

### Additional Features

Miniscript Studio also includes an integrated Policy and Miniscript references, based on sipa's Miniscript documentation, and settings to customize the workspace. Descriptions and tips can be hidden for a cleaner view, theme selection, auto compile. And of course, users can save work and load it any time. Sharing examples is easy, and also sharing new policies (as long as it uses default variables, or hex values). Also it's worth exploring tips and quick info section.

### Closing Thoughts

Miniscript represents a fundamental shift in how we approach Bitcoin script development ‚Äî from error-prone manual scripting to structured, verifiable spending conditions. While the underlying technology is powerful, its complexity has limited adoption.

Miniscript Studio bridges this gap by making these advanced capabilities accessible to developers at all levels. Whether you're exploring your first multisig setup or designing complex vault architectures, the Studio provides the tools and immediate feedback needed to build with confidence.

The combination of visual analysis, automatic key management, and comprehensive Taproot support transforms what was once a daunting task into an interactive learning experience. By lowering the barrier to entry, we can unlock Bitcoin Script's full potential for more developers and use cases.

I hope this tool helps you explore the possibilities of Bitcoin's programmability. Feedback and contributions are always welcome as we continue to make Bitcoin development more accessible.
